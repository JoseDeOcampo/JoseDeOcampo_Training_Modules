## Answers:
- 
1.) to track and manage changes to files and software code over time. It provides a structured and organized way for individuals or teams to collaborate on projects
2.) To create a branch you to us the command “git branch branch-name” hit enter. The branch should say (master) on top. So the new branch is created. And to check out the branch you have to use “git checkout branch-name”. hit enter and the branch will change from (master) to branch-name
3.) A git repository is cloned to provide an exact copy of all files and modifications present at the moment of the clone. The majority of the time, we'll be working on a remote repository (commonly referred to as a remote), which is a git repository that's located on the internet or another network that's

a repository that is online or on another network. By creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer by cloning, you can experiment without impacting the original code base. Additionally, cloning created a connection between your machine and the remote repository, enabling push and pull operations with the remote project. A single remote can have several clones made of it by another team.
4.) commiting a change can be interpreted a s creating a new “version” of your project which contains those new changes.

Commiting changes requires two steps/phases

a.) Adding the chnges to the staging

-you can do that with “git add file1.js” to the terminal. File1.js should be greens which means staged changed but the ones red below means they are still on unstage changes. However to add another file you give give it the command “git add src/file2.js”.

Running a git status shows the state of the git project.

b.) Taking a snapshot of the staging area

-taking a snapshot creates a commit which includes the changes in the staging area. Afterwards the staging area becomes empty.

c.) command “git commit -m “new stuff””

d.)”git log” will show all the commits there is to the project and the new ones that was made.

e.)after running “git status” the staging area should be clear.

5.) Pull request is used to allow developers to propose changes to a repository hosted. Its primarily used for collaboration, code review, and discussion before incorporating changes into the main codebase.
